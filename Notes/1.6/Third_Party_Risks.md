# Third Party Risks

There should be more security with 3rd party's as we are introducing an unknown risk into the organizational ecosystem. Always expect the worst and be prepared for a breach regardless of how secure and trustworthy it may seem. 

**System Integration Risk**
- individuals will have elevated access to do their job
    - hosting services
    - outsourcing development work (code base access, internal VPN, cloud access etc.)
    - application maintenance
    - on-site access to physical equipment
- higher risk b/c these workers are already on the network, by passing default security protocols
- lack of vendor support increases vulnerability risk

**Supply chain risK**
- cannot always control security @ 3rd party location
- every step along supply chain is a potential risk
- How do you know it's safe? Vendor software and hardware may contain malware 

**Data Storage**
- Cloud based services store tons of data in seperate, 3rd party location
- Is this location secure? Need encryption, limited exposure, secure data transfers etc.
- Relying on external source for handling PII
