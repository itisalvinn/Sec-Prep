# Vulnerability Types

Everything some vulnerability. It's up to us to identify them and safeguard our assets against attacks. 

**Open Permission**
- mistakes / misconfigs, 'door left open' and attacker has easy access
- no security applied
- increasingly common with cloud storage 
- e.g. June 2017, 14 million Verizon records exposed (3rd party left Amazon S3 data repo open)

**Open Accounts**
- unsecured root accounts 
- easy to hack passwords or default configs
- *prevention* -  disable direct login to root account (e.g. use sudo)
- error messages can provide too much info for attacker
    - service type
    - version info
    - debug data
    - e.g. Sept 2015, Patreon (debugger left exposed)

**Weak Encryption**
- need strong encryption protocol (SHA-256, AES-256 etc.)
    - length of encryption key (>128 bit keys)
    - type of hash
    - wireless encryption
- TLS security (transport layer security)
    - need to use strong cipher suite

**Insecure Protocols**
- some are not encrypted (e.g. Telnet, SMTP, IMAP)
- need to verify data with packet capture
- use encrypted protocols (e.g. SSH, SFTP)

**Default Settings**
- every app and network have default logins
- should update these ASAP (so easy to discover)
- Mirai botnet (open source)
    - takes advantage of default settings
    - large list of default configs 
    - e.g. cameras, routers, doorbells, garage door openers
- open ports and services
    - need to manage access with firewall
    - watch traffic flows
    - can become complex
    - always test and audit!!

**Patches**
- improper patch management poses a risk
- often centrally managed
    - load patch onto update server
    - test all apps before deploying to apps
    - helps efficiently manage bandwidth
- keep systems up to date
    - Firmware (BIOS)
    - OS (monthly, on-demand etc.)
    - Applications (manufacturer)
- e.g. July 2016, Equifax (huge PII data breach due to vulnerability unpatched server)

**Legacy systems**
- devices set up for a long time and no longer updated
- requires additional security protections
    - new firewall rules
    - IPS signature rules for older OS
- haha this happened to Indigo
