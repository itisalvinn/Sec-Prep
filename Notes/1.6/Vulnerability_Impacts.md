# Vulnerability Impacts

Financial impact. Reputational damage. Identify theft. System downtime etc.

**Data Loss**
- due to unsecured data bases (no password, default password)
- always need a back up
- e.g. July 2020, Internet facing data bases being deleted and replaced with 'meow' 

**Data theft**
- steal and use / selling PII of victims (e.g. names, SSN, birthdates, address etc.)
- long term impacts such as identity theft 
- e.g. July 2017, Equifax breach from Apache Struts (unpatched for months)

**Financial Loss**
- attackers steal money and other monetary assets
- e.g. March 2016, Bank of Bangladesh (attempt to transfer ~1 billion dollars via SWIFT vulnerability)

**Reputational Impacts**
- *looks bad* obviously and organizations have to disclose the incident
- stock prices drop, customer trust lost
- e.g. Oct 2016, Uber breach (attackers accessed names, emails, phone numbers)
    - did no publicly announce and struck a deal with the attackers
    - ended up paying $148m fines lmao
    - reputational damage and CSO charged

**Availability Loss**
- outages and downtime can still impact the company (systems and services unavailable)
- resultant monetary loss
- common culprit is ransomware holding company assets hostage
- e.g. Sept 2020, BancoEstado (all internal systems were down for over a week)
