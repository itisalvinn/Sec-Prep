# Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

Computers are getting smarter: 
1. can identify patterns in data
2. improve predictions
3. learn from training data (larger sets = faster, more complex advancements)

There are a large number of security solutions we can leverage with machine learning. Spam filters can be trained to better identify malicious emails, malware signatures can be recognized based on their behavioural patterns, and software can be created to identify vulnerabilities in a system and predict potential threats. 

- **Poisoned training Data** 
    - modified data sets that causes AI to behave incorrectly
    - confuses the learning algorithm into adapting the wrong information
    - only good as the programming and training process
    - e.g. Microsoft AI Chatter bot on Twitter became offensive 
    - prevention = *cross check data sets, retrain with new data, train against poisoned data**
