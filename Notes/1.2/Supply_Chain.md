# Supply Chain

This sector of an organization contains many moving parts - raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers. This is a large surface area of attack as any compromised section of this chain can have a large impact on the other parts *downstream* or *upstream*. Moreover, people trust their suppliers; therefore, there is a lot at stake.
