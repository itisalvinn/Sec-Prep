# Replication

**SAN replication**
- *Storage area network (SAN)* = specialized high performance network of storage devices
- fast recovery times
- *SAN to SAN replication* = duplicate date from one data center to another, centralized data center in real time
- *SAN snapshot* = create state of data at one point in time and copy to another SAN
    - take snapshop in intervals etc.

**VM Replication**
- virtual machine redundancy
    - maintain one VM and replicate to all others
- consistent service offering
- backup and recover from replicated copy
- efficient copying

**On Premise vs. Cloud**
- *speed of connection*
    - local devices are fast
    - cloud connections slower
- *financial cost*
    - on-site strorage is expensive
    - cloud has low entry point and can scale
- *security*
    - local data is private
    - cloud storage requires additional security controls
