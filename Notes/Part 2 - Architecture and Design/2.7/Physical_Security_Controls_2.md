# Physical Security Controls

**continued...**

The other file was just getting too long :(

**Cable locks**
- connect hardware to object, preventing theft
- temporary security
- portable and quick

**USB Data blocker**
- Allow voltage but reject data
    - can charge device but prevent information theft
- **basically** don't connect to unknown USB interfaces
- prevent *"juice jacking"*

**Video Surveillance**
- CCTV (closed circuit television)
- motion recognition
- object detection (e.g. license plate, face etc.)
- use a network of cameras

**Proper Lighting**
- more light = more security
- cameras have better vision
    - facial recognition
    - recording quality
    - avoid shadows / glare etc.
- increase exposure in the protected area

**Fencing**
- build and secure a perimeter
- signals that *there is something to protect*
- consider "transparent" fence
- need to be robust
    - height
    - strength
    - durability

**Fire Supression**
- smoke / flame / heat detection
- Chemical response
    - to **avoid water damage** to equipment
    - Dupont FM-200 / Halon etc.
- Water response
    - where **there aren't** any electronics


**Sensors**
- *motion detection* = identify movement
- *noise detection* = recognize increase in sound
- *proximity reader* = used w/ electronic door locks / access card
- *moisture detection* = identify water leaks
- *temperature detection* = monitor changes overtime
- also use drones to monitor over large areas
- *faraday cage* = mesh of conductive material to block electromagnetic fields
- *Screened subnet* = additional layer of security b/w Internet and internal users
