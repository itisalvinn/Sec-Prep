# Physical Security Controls

Ways to **prevent** threat actors from accessing your data, and assets etc.

**Barricades / Bollards**
- physical defense
- channel people through access point
    - easier to monitor in/out
- identify safety concerns

**Access Control Vestibule**
- all doors normally unlocked **BUT** opening one door causes others to lock
- all doors normally locked **AND** unlocking one door prevents others from unlock
- one open **other** locks; one open **other** cant be unlocked
- easily manage access and control groups

**Alarms**
- circuit based
    - open door / window breaks circuit
- motion detection
    - radio / infrared
- duress / panic btn

**Signage**
- clear and specific instructions
- keep ppl away from restricted areas
- safety concerns
    - fire exit
    - chemicals / construction etc.
    - medical resources
- contact info etc.


**Industrial Camouflage**
- conceal important facility in plain sight
- obvious location, nobody gonna know :^)
- strats:
    - no business signs
    - no visual clues
    - install guard gate / bollards
    - plants / gardening to obstruct view etc.

**Guards / Access lists**
- security guard
    - phsyical protection
    - *two person integrity* to minimize exposure to attack
- access list
    - enforced w/ visitor log etc.
- ID badge
    - picture
    - name etc.
    - proof of access

**Door Access Controls**
- conventional (e.g. lock and key)
- deadbolt (e.g. physical bolt)
- electronic (e.g. keyless, PIN)
- token based (e.g. RFID badge, swipe card, fob)

**Biometrics**
- authentication based on *something you are*
    - finger print
    - retine
    - voice
- stored as mathematical representation of biometric data
    - difficult to change
    - difficult to duplicate
- good with multi factor
    - e.g. fingerprint + code
