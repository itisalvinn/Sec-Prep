# Multifactor Authentication

**AAA FrameWork**
- authentication, authorization, accounting
- *identification* - who you claim to be (e.g. username)
- *authentication* - prove who you say who you are
- *authorization* - based on identification and auth, what access do you have?
- *accounting* - keeping track resources used (e.g. login tie, data sent / received, logout time etc.)

**Cloud vs. On-premise Auth**
- *cloud based*
    - 3rd party manage platform
    - centralized platform
    - automation options w/ API integration
- *on-premise*
    - internal monitoring and management
    - need internal expertise
    - external access must be managed and granted

**Multi-factor auth**
- *factors*
    - something you know (e.g. password, pin, pattern)
    - something you have (e.g. smart card, usb token, auth codes, sms)
    - something you are (e.g biometric, specific usage)
- *attributes*
    - somewhere you are (e.g. location based, geolocation)
    - something you can do (e.g. handwriting / signature)
    - something you exhibit (e.g. gait analysis, typing analysis)
    - someone you know (e.g. social factor, digital signature, web of trust)
