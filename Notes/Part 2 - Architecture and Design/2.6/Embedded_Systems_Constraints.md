# Embedded Systems Constraints

Usually an embedded systems device is not a fully capable computer. For example, a rasperry pi! However, this means they are generally low cost and built for a purpose but carry a number of constraints!

**Constraints**
- *trade off* for low cost and unique management challenges
- limited or missing features
    - b/c they're designed with particular function in mind
    - not flexible
- upgradability limitations
    - e.g. operating system, memory
- limited communication options
    - e.g. wifi vs ethernet
- power limitations
    - may not have access to main power source
    - replace batteries etc.
- computing limitations
    - low power = lower speed
    - cost vs heat
- network limitations
    - possible for wired connection in a remote area?
    - wireless transmission distance?
- cost vs quality of materials
- security posture limitations
    - may not have access to OS

**Cryptography**
- limited hardware options
- difficult to modify crpyto features
- inablity / difficult to patch (e.g. firmware)
- authentication afterthought
