# Automation and Scripting

Always plan for change! Automating courses of action and active monitoring threats that are detected keeps the system robust and secure. 

**Continuous Integration (CI)**
- code is constantly written and merged into central repo many times a day
- need basic set of security checks during development (e.g. document security baselines)
- large scale security analysis during testing

**Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)**
- automate testing and release process
- easily, and quickly deploy an application 
- generate alerts if tests fail; otherwise continue to production
