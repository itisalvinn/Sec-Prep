# Site Resiliency

Always need a disaster recovery plan! Ensure recovery site is prepped and data is synchronized. This backup site could operate for a while before the organization can revert back to it's original state. As such, documentation is important!

**Hot Site**
- exact replica of production environment
- duplicate hardware
- hardware and software constantly updated and synchronized
- should be easy to switch to disaster recovery site

**Cold Site**
- no hardware
- no data stored
- no people / team
- *everything must be brought over*

**Warm Site**
- just enough to get going
- room for hardware
- requires some set up and configuration
- bring software and data over to the site
- level of preparation depends on how much an organization is willing to upkeep this warm site
