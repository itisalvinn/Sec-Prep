# Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

We have so much sensitive data in our daily lives and we must protect them against attackers!

**Endpoint**
- data in use
- examines everything on our device

**Network**
- data in motion
- examine all packets going across network
- make sure sensitive info is stored securely

**Server**
- data at rest
- storage of sensitive data at risk virtually and physically

**USB Blocking**
- allow or deny certain tasks on a workstation
- e.g. Nov 2008, US Dept of Defense (agent.btz worm replicated with USB storage)
- constant device update with strict policies to operate flash drives

**Cloud Based**
- stored outside of organization, in the cloud
- traffic between user and internet (no hardware / software)
- block customed defined data strings
- manage access to URLs
    - prevent file tarnsfers to cloud stroage
- block viruses from travelling across the network

**Email**
- critical risk vector
    - inbound threats (e.g. block keywords, impostors)
    - outbound data loss (e.g. fake wire transfers, employee info)
- very easy to transfer information
- internal / cloud based system to categorize sensitive info
- e.g. Nov 2016, Boeing employee emailed spreadsheet template (contained hidden data of 36000 employees)
