# Vulnerability Scans

The process of discovering, analyzing, and reporting on security flaws and vulnerabilities. Often conducted with automated systems, they are effective at identifying potential risk exposures and attack vectors across an organization's network, hardware, software, and overall system. *An essential step in the vulnerability management lifecycle*. It allows the organization to take the next step of remediate discovered vulnerabilities such as deploying a patch, closing exposed ports, updating misconfigured systems etc. 

**Port Scan**
- e.g. nmap 192.168.1.1
- determine what ports are responding on particular IP address
- identify what ports are open and available
- test from inside and outside

**Scan types**
- *non-intrusive scans* = just gather info but do not exploit the vulnerability
- *intrusive scans* = test if the vulnerability works (e.g. pen test)
- *non-credential scans* = scanner cannot logni to the remote device
- *credentialed scan* = normal user, emulates insider attack
- e.g. Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Scanner

**Identify Vulnerabilities**
- scanner sifts through a ton of data for known vulnerabilities (signatures)
- Application Scans (desktop, mobile apps)
    - CVE-2020-1889, What's App Desktop version (security feature bypass issue allowed escalation of privilege)
- Web application scans (software on web server)
    - CVE-2020-24981, UCMS (Incorrect Access Control vulnerability results in info leak via error msg)
- Network scans (misconfigured firewalls, open ports etc.)
    - CVE-2020-25079, D-Link DCS-2530L router (allowed authenticated command injection)
    - require firmware update from manufacturer

**Vulnerability Research**
- cross reference vulnerabilities online 
- [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (NVD)
    - full synchronized with MITRE CVE list, maintained by NIST
    - Common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) **b/w 0-10**
- [Common Vulnerabilities Database](https://cve.mitre.org/) (CVE)
    - publicly list of disclosed vulnerabilities and exposures maintained by MITRE
- Go to manufacturer themselves for up-to-date information
- industry collaboration also important
    - enhanced feed to share information
    - improved automation of alerts

*Note: scanner's give you information about potential vulnerabilities, it is ultimately up to the user to investigate and verify if that is the case*

**Vulnerability Scan log Review**
- identify lack of security controls
    - no firewall
    - no antivirus
    - no anti spyware
- identify misconfigurations
    - open shares
    - guest login access
- identify real vulnerabilities
    - new potential exploits in software 
    - older, overlooked issues

**False Positives / Negatives**
- False positives
    - vulnerability identified that doesn't exist
    - *not low severity* , just not a vulnerability
- False negatives
    - vulnerability exists, but was not detected
    - keep vulnerability scanners up to date w/ latest signatures
- work with vulnerability detection manufacturer to update their DB

**Configuration Review**
- Validate security of device configs (*easy to misconfigure!!*)
- Workstations
    - account configs
    - local device settings
- Servers
    - access controls
    - permission settings
- Security devices
    - firewall rules
    - authentication options
