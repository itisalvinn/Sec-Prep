# Threat Intelligence

The knowledge, skills, and experienced based info concerning the occurrence and assessment of both physical and digital threats intended to help mitigate potential attacks and events against organizational assets. The important part is *knowing that a threat exists* and make decisions based on this intelligence. *Data is everywhere!*

**Open source intel**
- publicly available resources
    - internet (discussion groups, social media, blogs etc.)
    - government data (reports, public hearings, websites etc.)
- commercial data (maps, financial reports, databases etc.)

**Closed / proprietary intel**
- compiled from many diff sources (variety of perspectives, constantly up to date)
- available at a cost
- organized in a way to easily identify potential threats against the organization
- helps with automated workflows to identify and prevent such threats as well

**Vulnerability Databases**
- researchers find vulnerabilities and publish them
- CVE (common vulnerabilities and exposure)
- NVD (US national vulnerability database)
- constantly updated w/ info and scoring about new and existing vulnerabilities

**Public / private info sharing centers**
- public threat intel (classified info made public)
- private threat intel (extensive resources from certain companies in the industry)
- real time sharing of critical and quality security details
- Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA)

**Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)**
- industry standard format
- Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX)
    - cyber threat info detail
    - motivations
    - capabilities
    - abilities
    - response information
- also need a way to exchange such info securely
- Trusted Automated eXchange of Indiciator Info (TAXII)
    - secure way to share STIX data

**Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**
- specific activity that indicates a threat actor has breached your network
- e.g. unusual amount of network activity, new hash values, DNS server changes etc.
- Activities that are 'out of the norm'  - that is why it is important to maintain logs, and records of events so they can be used as a benchmark for pattern recognition and threat identification

**Predictive Analysis**
- analyze large amounts of data to identify suspicious patterns and behaviours
- combine diff knowledge of network traffic patterns, location data etc. to forecast potential attacks
- "early warning signs" of a threat actor attempting to attack
- can also use ML

**Threat Maps**
- worldwide perspective of identified attacks and trends
- useful to stay informed
- real time data (e.g. FireEye)

**File / Code repositories**
- see what hackers are building! (e.g. GitHub)
- accidental publication of private code
    - can find exploits
    - phishing attacks
