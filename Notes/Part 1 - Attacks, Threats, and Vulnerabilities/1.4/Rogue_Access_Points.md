# Rogue Access Points

Access point added to your network without your authorization (e.g. backdoor). Therefore, performing periodic security audits can help discover such access points and mitigate the probability of an attack. It is also good practice to be informed and aware of what devices / users are connected to your network at any given time. 

**Network Access Control**

- IEEE802.1X protocol (standard for port based network access control)
- user must authenticate, regardless of connection type (e.g. employee login @ company wifi)

**Wireless evil twin**
- looks legit but is malicious
- similar SSID / security settings as an existing network 
- stronger connection than existing access points (convinces the user to connect to this one instead)
- e.g. wifi hotspot 
- *always use HTTPS and VPN* to protect your wireless traffic
