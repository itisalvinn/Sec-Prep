# Threat Research

Process of gathering and analyzing info about potential cyber threats.\
Know your enemy. Constant battle. Always different. 

**Vendor Websites**
- start at the source
- they know their product better than anyone (or they should!)
- often first to know about their vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability feeds**
- automated vulnerability notifications (e.g. CVE data feeds)
- 3rd party feeds for additional coverage
- aggregate into vulnerability management system

**Academic Journals**
- *NERD!!*
- research from academic professionals
- evaluations of existing security technologies
- detailed dive of the topic; very informative

**Request for comments (RFC)**
- numbered document, includes appraisals, descriptions, and definitions of online protocols, concepts etc.
- not all are standard documents (e.g. best practices, experimental etc.)
- e.g. RFC 3833 = Threat analysis of Domain name system

**Local Community**
- local industry groups & peers sharing tech and industry knowledge of threats 
- networking opportunity
- additional connections / more resources
- *Conferences*
    - watch and learn from experts
    - researches discussing new security methods, risks, attacks and trends
    - networking and building relationships

**Social Media**
- hacking group conversations
- honeypot monitoring on twitter
- *search keywords* = CVE-2020-*, bugbounty, 0-day

**Threat feeds**
- automated threat feeds to stay informed
- e.g. US Homeland Security, US FBI, VirusTotal Intelligence (Meta+Google)
- *TTP (tactics, techniques, procedures)* = understanding the attacker
    - what are adversaries doing and how do they do it?
    - proactively look for threats given knowledge attacker behaviour
    - varies depending on attack
