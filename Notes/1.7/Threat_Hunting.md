# Threat Hunting

Cat and Mouse. How can we find the attacker before they get access to our data?\
Intelligence data is reactive - therefore we must speed up reaction time. 

**Intelligence Fusion**
- a large number of data to detect, analyze, and react
- large variety of data types and scopes
- cross functional teams must communicate different types of data w/ each other
- *Fuse security data with big data analytics*

**Fusing data**
- Collection (logging, monitor metrics etc.)
- Add external sources (threat feeds, government alerts etc.)
- Correlate with big data analytics (predictive and user behaviour + mathematical analysis)

**Cybersecurity Maneuvers**
- Physical (e.g. military)
- Virtual (e.g. firewalls, scans, IPS etc.)
- automated deployment and instantaneous reaction

**Always evolving and improving**
